# Pacing Ads Block

A pacing dashboard is designed to provide a centralized view of campaign performance over time. It allows marketers to track key metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions revenue, cost per acquisition (CPA) and other relevant metrics against predetermined pacing goals. This visual representation helps identify areas where campaigns are ahead or behind schedule, enabling timely adjustments to optimize performance.
Our Pacing Block is specifically tailored to digital marketing managers, performance marketers and almost everyone working with ads data. By providing granular insights into ad data.
This repository contains views and explores used for the Multisource Ads Block dashboards, currently supporting Meta Ads and Google Ads with a view to integrate more ad sources overtime. There are several dashboards that come with this block, Core Metrics, Campaign Manager that also includes Marketing Campaign Comparison and Spend vs Revenue, additionally, there are two demo dashboards where you can find the Goal vs Value optional feature, and take a look to the Period Over Period dashboard with a forecasting visualization. Each of the dashboards provides in-depth analysis of ad/campaign performance.

The LookML constants are used to specify the name of the schema and connection.
They are defined in the manifest file of this project and ready to be replaced for your parameters.


### Requirements

This block requires a data transfer to a single BigQuery project from the ads datasets. Fields coming from these raw tables are worked in our block by adding description to the relevant fields and the calculated fields have been created, sames that are later leveraged by the multisource_ads view.

#Facebook - Meta
Here is the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/facebook-ads-transfer) about how to do this transfer process.

#Google Ads
Here is the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transfer) about how to do this transfer process.

## Custom Visualizations:


   - Go to Marketplace > Discover and search for "Radial Gauge" and install




## Installation

#### Constants

On block installation you will need to specify the following constants:

```
constant: CONNECTION_NAME {
 value: "Connection name"
 export: override_required
}

constant: PROJECT_ID {
  value: "Project ID"
  export: override_required
}

## Leave the value empty (value:"") if you're not using the source, otherwise you'll get an error


constant: FADS_DATASET_NAME {
  value: "Facebook Ads Dataset"
  export: override_required
}

constant: GADS_DATASET_NAME {
  value: "Google Ads Dataset"
  export: override_required
}

constant: GADS_CUSTOMER_ID {
  value: "Customer ID"
  export: override_required
}


```

Select the [BigQuery connection](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery) that has access to the ads datasets. Looker will require PDTs to be enabled on this connection to create derived tables that will be leveraged by the block.




#### Model Access

- Ensure that all users that want to use this block have access to the newly created models (this will need to be done after the block is installed)
- Users will need to have a Looker role that either includes all model sets (e.g. an admin) or have a new role created which includes the model `fb_ads`, `google_ads`, `pacing_block`

### Optional functionalities

#Campaigns goals created from Manifest File

There are 5 types of fields included to leverage campaign information from your sources and create a derived table that unifies it and that you can later join to any of your sources explores and get global goals values for certain campaigns. For this to be possible it’s necessary that you unify across sources the Campaign names of the ones you’re interested to use.

```
#### Information Campaign 1 #####

constant: CAMPAIGN_NAME_1 {
  value: "your_campaign_name"
  export: override_optional
}

constant: DATE_START_CMP_1 {
  value: "2024-05-01" # Start date of your campaign
  export: override_optional
}

constant: DATE_END_CMP_1 {
  value: "2024-10-10" # End date of your campaign
  export: override_optional
}

constant: GOAL_CMP_1 {
  value: "1500000" # Goal Value
  export: override_optional
}

constant: GOAL_TYPE_CMP_1 {
  value: "Clicks" # Type of Goal
  export: override_optional
}


```


# Campaigns created from Google Sheets


Based on the sheets template included in the repo as campaigns_info, create a copy in Google Sheet in order to modify the values and  [follow these steps](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/connected-sheets#use
) to connect it to your BigQuery dataset, along the Data transfers.

It’s necessary to share the sheets template to the Service account user this is the same created to connect to your BigQuery dataset.
